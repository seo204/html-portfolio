<h1>Serdar's Favourite Movies of all Time</h1>
<h2>Best Movies Ever</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>This is a great movie because one of its producers is actually an atom physicist and many phenomenons that are depicted in the movie are actually very close to reality.</p>
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>It is an elaboration of many philosophical approaches to human existence within a fantastic digital world.</p>
<h3>Bruce Almighty</h3>
<p>It is an extremely funny movie with the great acting skills of Jim Carrey. It is about a journalist who blames God for all his failures, and God gives him all his powers so that he could try doing better than Him.</p>
